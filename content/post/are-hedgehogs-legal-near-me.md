## How Do I Know if Hedgehogs Are Legal?

If you're reading this from New England, then you're all set, because hedgehogs are legal everywhere in New England. Unfortunately, other regions aren't so lucky, and some states have it out for these lovable little prickleballs!

A [Southern New Hampshire-based hedgehog breeder](https://www.hamorhollow.com/) has a great resource outlining [everywhere in the United States where hedgehogs are legal and illegal](https://www.hamorhollow.com/articles/are-hedgehogs-legal-in-my-state):

- [Are Hedgehogs Legal in My State?](https://www.hamorhollow.com/articles/are-hedgehogs-legal-in-my-state)

Some states that have made hedgehogs illegal claim that hedgehogs could become an invasive species (They won't â€” hedgehogs can't survive outdoors in North American climates that are much colder than the hot African climates that they thrive in.).

If you live in a state where hedgehogs are illegal, please search for local hedgehog groups that are helping to make them legal.
