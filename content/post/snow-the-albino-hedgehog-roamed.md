>Snow the albino hedgehog roamed,  
Through fields and woods, all alone.  
Her heart was pure, her love was true,  
But finding a mate, that was a struggle too.  

>Her quills were white, like fresh fallen snow,  
And her eyes were pink, aglow.  
But to some, she seemed quite a sight,  
Not the usual brown hedgehog in sight.  

>Snow searched high, and low, with care,  
For a love that would be fair.  
A heart that would love her for who she is,  
Not judge her by her unusual appearance.  

>And then one day, as luck would have it,  
She met a hedgehog, oh so fit!  
With quills of brown, and eyes so bright,  
Together, they took flight.  

>So here's to Snow, our loveable sap,  
Who found love, with just one snap.  
A perfect match, a heart so warm,  
Together, they'll weather any storm.
